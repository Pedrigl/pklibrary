						<p>
							Most moves have an effect, from common ones like poisoning the foe, to unique ones like Transform. Each different effect has its own <b>function code</b>, which is a hexadecimal number. Every move must have a function code (there is even one for "no effect").
						</p><p>
							All move effects (except for Shadow moves) are described in the script section <b>PokeBattle_MoveEffects</b>.
						</p><p>
							Function codes work alongside move flags, as they both describe how a move works. Some special aspects of a move (e.g. thaws a frozen user, has a high critical hit rate) are dealt with just by the move flags; in which case, moves with just those special aspects (e.g. Slash only has a high critical hit rate) will have the function code 000 (no effect) as they don't do anything else special.

							If you are inventing a new move effect, you should use function code 176 and onwards (176, 177, 178, etc.). However, you can use any function code that is not already used, and it is recommended that you start higher up, just in case an update to Essentials adds some more itself.
